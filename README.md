You know when someone sends you a post, you want to take a quick look‚Ä¶ and suddenly you're scrolling for 30 minutes? Been there.

I built Redirect Me to stop that cycle.
The goal was simple: view the post, then get out.
If I started navigating, the extension would catch me and instantly redirect me somewhere more intentional.

I looked for tools like this but couldn‚Äôt find one that worked the way I needed, so I built my own.
With Redirect Me, you set up custom redirect rules: if you open a distracting link, it takes you directly to a better destination.

Why use it:
Instantly redirect away from distracting pages or any goal that works for you.

Simple and fast.

Turn accidental distractions into intentional focus.
Install Redirect Me and stay on track.
